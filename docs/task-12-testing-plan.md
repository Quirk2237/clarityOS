# Task 12: Business Context Integration - Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for validating the integration of user onboarding data into guided discovery sessions.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Authenticated User with Complete Onboarding Data

**Setup:**
- User is logged in with valid Supabase session
- Profile contains complete business information:
  - `business_name`: "Example Corp"
  - `business_stage`: "one_to_five_years" 
  - `what_your_business_does`: "Software development services"

**Expected Behavior:**
- `useBusinessContext()` returns:
  - `hasData: true`
  - `source: 'authenticated'`
  - Complete business data from profile
- AI receives personalized system prompt with:
  - Business name, stage, and description
  - Stage-specific guidance for "1-5 Years Operating"
  - Contextual questions referencing their specific business
- Guided discovery questions are tailored to their business context

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as authenticated user with complete profile
2. Navigate to any brand card (e.g., Purpose)
3. Start guided discovery session
4. Verify initial AI question references business context
5. Check browser console for business context logging
6. Verify AI responses are personalized to their business stage

### Scenario 2: Anonymous User with Onboarding Data in AsyncStorage

**Setup:**
- User is not authenticated (no Supabase session)
- Anonymous onboarding data exists in AsyncStorage:
  - `business_name`: "My Startup"
  - `business_stage`: "conceptualizing"
  - `what_your_business_does`: "Mobile app development"

**Expected Behavior:**
- `useBusinessContext()` returns:
  - `hasData: true`
  - `source: 'anonymous'`
  - Complete business data from AsyncStorage
- AI receives personalized system prompt with:
  - Business name, stage, and description from session storage
  - Stage-specific guidance for "Conceptualizing"
  - Questions focused on validation and early-stage concerns

**Test Steps:**
1. Clear all authentication (logout completely)
2. Complete onboarding form to populate AsyncStorage
3. Navigate to any brand card
4. Start guided discovery session
5. Verify AI questions are tailored to "conceptualizing" stage
6. Check that business name is referenced in conversation
7. Verify console shows `source: 'anonymous'` in logs

---

### Scenario 3: Legacy User with No Onboarding Data

**Setup:**
- User may be authenticated or anonymous
- No onboarding data available in either profile or AsyncStorage
- This simulates existing users who haven't completed new onboarding

**Expected Behavior:**
- `useBusinessContext()` returns:
  - `hasData: false`
  - `source: 'none'`
  - All business fields are null
- AI receives generic system prompt without business context
- Conversation flows exactly as it did before integration
- No errors or UI breakage
- Graceful fallback to non-personalized experience

**Test Steps:**
1. Clear all onboarding data (profile + AsyncStorage)
2. Navigate to brand card
3. Start guided discovery session
4. Verify AI asks generic discovery questions
5. Confirm no console errors related to missing business context
6. Ensure conversation quality matches pre-integration experience
7. Test both authenticated and anonymous legacy scenarios

## Integration Points Validation

### 1. useBusinessContext Hook
- [ ] Returns correct data structure for all scenarios
- [ ] Handles loading states properly
- [ ] Manages authentication state changes
- [ ] Provides accurate `hasData` boolean
- [ ] Sources data from correct location based on auth state

### 2. Guided Discovery Component
- [ ] Properly imports and uses useBusinessContext
- [ ] Passes business context to AI service
- [ ] Handles loading states during context retrieval
- [ ] No console errors when business context is unavailable

### 3. AI Edge Function
- [ ] Accepts businessContext parameter in request body
- [ ] Logs business context information appropriately
- [ ] Passes context to getSystemPrompt function
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility when context is missing

### 4. Prompt System
- [ ] Injects business context into base prompt when available
- [ ] Provides stage-specific guidance based on business_stage
- [ ] Falls back gracefully when no context provided
- [ ] Task-specific prompts utilize business information appropriately

---

## Performance Validation

### Load Times
- [ ] No significant performance degradation in guided discovery startup
- [ ] AsyncStorage reads don't block UI rendering
- [ ] Profile data loading doesn't delay conversation start

### Memory Usage
- [ ] No memory leaks from business context state management
- [ ] Proper cleanup when switching between auth states
- [ ] Efficient data storage and retrieval

---

## Error Handling Validation

### Network Issues
- [ ] Graceful degradation when profile fetch fails
- [ ] Proper error handling for AsyncStorage read failures
- [ ] AI service continues working when business context unavailable

### Data Corruption
- [ ] Invalid business_stage values handled appropriately
- [ ] Malformed AsyncStorage data doesn't crash app
- [ ] Missing required fields don't prevent chat functionality

---

## Cross-Platform Testing

### iOS
- [ ] AsyncStorage works correctly on iOS
- [ ] Business context integration functions on iOS
- [ ] No platform-specific issues

### Android  
- [ ] AsyncStorage works correctly on Android
- [ ] Business context integration functions on Android
- [ ] No platform-specific issues

### Web
- [ ] localStorage fallback works for anonymous users
- [ ] Business context integration functions in web environment

---

## Regression Testing

### Existing Functionality
- [ ] All existing guided discovery features work unchanged
- [ ] Educational quiz sections unaffected
- [ ] Progress tracking continues to function
- [ ] Brand statement generation works correctly
- [ ] User authentication flows remain intact

### Data Migration
- [ ] Existing authenticated users see no disruption
- [ ] Anonymous user data persists correctly
- [ ] No data loss during authentication state changes
