# Brand Onboarding Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement an onboarding screen that captures essential brand information from users after they click "Get Started" from the welcome screen. This information will be used to personalize AI-driven guided discovery throughout the application.

- Use brand context to personalize AI interactions
- Improve user experience with relevant, contextual guidance
