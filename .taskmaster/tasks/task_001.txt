# Task ID: 1
# Title: Update Database Schema for Brand Information
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add 'brand_name' and 'brand_description' columns to the 'profiles' table in Supabase. This will store the essential brand information collected during the new onboarding flow.
# Details:
Create a new SQL migration script. The script should contain the following commands: `ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN brand_name TEXT;` and `ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN brand_description TEXT;`. Additionally, review and update the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `profiles` table to ensure users can only read and write their own brand information. The existing policy for updates should cover this, but it's crucial to verify.

# Test Strategy:
Run the migration script in a development environment. Connect to the Supabase database and verify that the `profiles` table contains the `brand_name` and `brand_description` columns. Test RLS by authenticating as a user and attempting to update another user's profile data via an API call; the request should be denied.
