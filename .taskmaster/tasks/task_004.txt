# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Onboarding Form Logic and API Submission
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate form state management, validation, and the API call into the Brand Onboarding screen. This task makes the UI functional.
# Details:
Use a library like `react-hook-form` to manage form state and validation. Both `brand_name` and `brand_description` fields must be required. On button press, `handleSubmit` will trigger validation. If successful, it will call the Supabase update function from Task 2. Implement loading and disabled states for the button during the API call. Display clear, user-friendly error messages for both validation failures and API errors.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the validation rules. Manually test the complete form flow: 1) Try to submit with empty fields and verify error messages appear. 2) Fill the form and submit; verify a loading indicator shows and the user is navigated away on success. 3) Mock an API error and verify a user-friendly error message is displayed.
